    Q.1	Write one example explaining how you can write a callback function.
    </h2>
    <h2><pre>
        function greet(callback) {
            console.log("welcome to prepbytes");
            callback();
        }


        function callMe() {
            console.log('I am callback function');
        }


        greet(callMe);

    </pre></h2>
    <h3><pre>
        output:welcome to prepbytes
               I am callback function 

    </pre></h3>
    <h3>Explaination:Here i have created two functions and i called greet(callme) with second function name like
        callme after that greet function will execute and then there is a one callback function. then we get the output
    </h3>

    Explaination:A promise is an object to  handle the  asynchronous operations and 
    It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not. 
    A promise has  three kind of  states like pending and resolved , rejected. if task was executed then we get result
    otherwise error

<h3>
    output:welcome to real world

<h3>
    Explaination:Normally all assigned asynchronous operations are start at same time but here in my code i used async 
    keyword to the function like async function demo() and there is await keyword in my function here the purpose await keyword is 
    wait for the result of that statement, and completion of the statement then only it will move to next line
